### Report Sheet Questions: 

# 1:

> In the pre lab, you were introduced to the operation of a pull-up resistor. You then used a pull-up resistor in the lab as an input for your chaser. Could a resistor value lower than the one used in the lab work as a pull-up resistor? What about a higher value? Which would you choose and why?
>>A pull-up resistor of a lower value could still work but it can cause issues by using a lot of power when the circuit is closed. A higher resistance value would make it harder to verify the state of the switch as the current would be very small. I would probably choose to go with a slightly higher resistance value as it would be more efficient when the circuit is closed.

# 2: 

>Using your understanding of a pull-up resistor with a switch, draw a pull-down resistor with a switch that uses a resistor value of 1.5 kÎ©.

# 3: 

> Explain how a pulldown resistor would work.
>>A pulldown resistor works by ensuring that a wire is pulled to a ground state, or logic low (0), when it's not being actively driven by anything else. This is done by connecting a resistor between the wire and ground. In digital circuits, a floating signal could switch between high or low states due to electrical noise in the system. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect readings. By using a pulldown resistor, the line will always be pulled to a known state (low) unless it's being actively driven high by connected equipment.

# 4:

> In Part 4 of the lab you used an analog pin. The incoming voltage is assigned a value between 0 and 1023. Why do you think the range of values is exactly 1024?
>>The range of values is exactly 1024 because the Arduino uses a 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC). This means it can represent the analog value with 1024 digital levels (2^10 = 1024), which ranges from 0 to 1023.
